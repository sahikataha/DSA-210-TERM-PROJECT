DSA-210-TERM-PROJECT — Sabancı University
Comparative Analysis of Electric Vehicle Charging Network Operators in Istanbul

Project Overview

This project analyzes the distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging station operators in Istanbul using publicly available data from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) Open Data Portal.

The primary aim is to understand how EV charging infrastructure is spread across the European and Asian sides of the city and to identify whether certain operators show stronger presence in specific regions. As EV adoption increases, fair access to charging stations becomes increasingly critical for sustainable urban transport planning.

The key research questions of this project are:

Which operator has the largest EV charging network in Istanbul?

How are these operators distributed across the European vs. Asian sides?

Does the overall number of charging stations significantly differ between the two sides of the city?

To answer these questions, the study applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and hypothesis testing techniques.

Motivation

Electric vehicle usage has grown rapidly in recent years, making charging infrastructure a crucial component of sustainable mobility. In a megacity like Istanbul, where millions of people rely on urban transportation, ensuring balanced access to EV charging stations is essential.
This project aims to:

Identify whether charging stations are unevenly distributed between the European and Asian sides.
Examine whether certain operators dominate one side more than the other.
Provide data-driven insights to support decision-makers, city planners, and private companies in improving infrastructure fairness and accessibility.

Data Sources
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Data
The dataset is obtained from the İBB Open Data Portal and includes:

Charging station name
Operator
Latitude and longitude
Region information (district and neighborhood)
Operational status
The dataset contains no personal or sensitive information and is provided in CSV format.
Objectives of the Study

1. Operator Distribution Analysis
Count the number of stations per operator.
Compare operators’ overall presence in Istanbul.
Identify which operators have stronger concentration on each side of the city.

2. Spatial Pattern Analysis
Map station locations by latitude and longitude.
Compare the density of stations between the European and Asian sides.
Visualize regional differences using geographic plots.

3. Statistical Analysis
Conduct hypothesis tests to determine whether the number of charging stations differs significantly between the two sides of the city.
Examine whether operator presence shows side-based variation.

4. Visualization and Reporting
Create clear visualizations using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and folium.
Summarize findings with interpretive commentary in a written report.

Expected Outcomes
The project is expected to deliver:

Identification of the main EV charging operators in Istanbul.
Visual comparisons of operator presence on the European and Asian sides.
Geographic visualizations showing the distribution of EV stations.
A hypothesis test revealing whether the two sides differ significantly in charging infrastructure density.
Practical insights to support more equitable infrastructure planning.

Ethical Considerations
All data used in this study are public, aggregated, and non-personal. No individual-level or sensitive information is included in the analysis.
