Comparative Analysis of Electric Vehicle Charging Network Operators in Istanbul

Project Overview

In this project, the distribution and coverage of electric vehicle (EV) charging station operators in Istanbul are analyzed. Open data from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) Open Data Portal is used for the analysis.

First, the geographic distribution of charging stations is studied. The main goal is to find out which companies have the largest EV charging networks and how access to these stations changes between different districts and city areas (European and Asian sides).

EV infrastructure is seen as very important in Istanbul’s move toward sustainable urban transport. As more people start using electric vehicles, fair access to charging stations becomes more important. Therefore, the spatial imbalance between different networks must be understood. These insights can help city planners and private companies improve where and how they invest in EV infrastructure.
The key research questions in this project are:

Which operator has the biggest EV charging network in Istanbul?
How are these operators spread across districts and regions (European vs. Asian side)?
Is there a clear connection between the number of stations and the population in each district?

To answer these questions, data science methods are applied. These include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, data visualization, and simple hypothesis testing. Through these methods, patterns in the location and operation of EV charging stations are discovered.

Motivation

As more electric vehicles are used, charging infrastructure is seen as a key part of sustainable transport. In Istanbul, where the population is large and there are many vehicles, expanding EV charging networks brings both opportunities and challenges.

This project is guided by the following goals:

To show if charging stations are placed unequally in different parts of the city.

To check if some operators are more active in certain districts or regions.

To give useful, data-based information that can help decision-makers and other stakeholders plan fairer investments in infrastructure.

Public data from the city government is analyzed in this study. In this way, a clear and evidence-based method is used to support better planning for urban sustainability and mobility.

Data Sources

1. Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Data

The data is taken from the İBB Open Data Portal. It includes the name, operator, location (latitude and longitude), district, neighborhood, and operational status of each EV charging station in Istanbul.

The dataset is updated from time to time by İBB. The most recent version available will be used in this study.
The data is provided in CSV format.

2. District-Level Population Data (for Comparison)
   
This data is obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) or İBB’s population datasets.
It is used to calculate the number of charging stations per 10,000 residents in each district. This helps to compare how accessible the charging stations are across different areas.

Both datasets are publicly available and do not contain any personal or sensitive information.

Objectives of the Study

The main goals of this project are grouped into four areas:

1. Operator Distribution Analysis

The number of stations for each operator will be counted.
The market share of each operator will be calculated.
The total coverage area of each operator will be compared.

2. Spatial Pattern Study
All charging station locations will be mapped using their latitude and longitude.
It will be identified which areas (European or Asian side) have a higher density of charging stations.

3. Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis tests will be carried out to check if there are important differences between operator distributions on the two sides of the city.
The relationship between station density and population will be examined.

4. Visualization and Reporting
Visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and geographic heatmaps will be created using Python libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and folium.
Key findings will be explained using clear, data-based visuals and a written report.

Expected Outcomes

The study is expected to produce the following results:

The main EV charging station operators in Istanbul will be identified.
Maps will be created to show where charging stations are more common across districts.
Differences in infrastructure between regions will be highlighted.
Statistical results will show whether the European and Asian sides of the city have different levels of coverage.
Suggestions will be made to help policymakers improve access and fairness in charging station distribution.

Ethical Considerations
All data used in this study are public, grouped, and non-personal.
No private or sensitive information is included in the analysis.
